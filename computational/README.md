In this directory you can find the source code of most computational programs that we used for our research. Programs were written in C++ (in the `cpp/` subdirectory), Mathematica (in the `mma/` subdirectory), and Sage (in the `sage/` subdirectory).

## Computing environment

Our computing environment at the time of research was:

*   Operating system: OS X 10.9.4;
*   C++: compiler - Apple LLVM version 5.1 (`clang-503.0.40`); FLINT library - version 2.4.4 (`libflint` built for `x86_64-Darwin`);
*   Mathematica: Student Edition, version 9.0.1.0;
*   Sage: version 6.2.

We also used Stanford's [barley cluster](https://itservices.stanford.edu/service/sharedcomputing/environments) for batch execution of the compiled C++ programs.

## Documentation

Unfortunately, our source code was not well-documented for the most part. Please feel free to contact the author with questions or comments. Contact information: Zhiming Wang &lt;<zmwang@stanford.edu>&gt;.
